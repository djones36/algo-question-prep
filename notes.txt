PROBLEM SOLVING STRAGIES
A set of steps to help solving new problems.
1.	Understand the Problem
2.	Explore Concrete Examples
3.	Break It Down
4.	Solve/Simplify
5.	Look Back and Refactor
Each one is part of the plan to solve the problem

UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
Questions to ask: 
1.	Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2.	What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3.	What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4.	Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5.	How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
 
REFACTORING QUESTIONS
•	Can you check the result?
•	Can you derive the result differently?
•	Can you understand it at a glance?
•	Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
•	Can you improve the performance of your solution?
•	Can you think of other ways to refactor?
•	How have other people solved this problem?
